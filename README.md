# brunch-signature

[Brunch][] plugin which generates a unique signature as part of the `brunch
build` process. The signature changes whenever any file in the project is
modified.

I am using brunch-signature to alert users when a new version of the app has
been deployed. I Ajax poll `/signature` and check for a difference form the
value when the app first started. When it's different, I show a banner telling
the user to refresh.

## Usage

Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save brunch-signature`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"brunch-signature": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"brunch-signature": "git+ssh://git@github.com:mutewinter/brunch-signature.git"`.

_Optional_ Specify [plugin settings](#settings) in config.coffee. For example:

```coffeescript
exports.config =
  # ...
  plugins:
    signature:
      file: 'signature'
      ignore: /[\\/][.]/
```

## Settings

### signature.ignore

A regular expression specifying paths to omit from the signature.

Default value : `/[/][.]/` (hidden files and files in hidden directories are ignored)

### signature.file

Output filename. For example:

```coffeescript
file: "app.signature"
```

Default value : `"signature"`
